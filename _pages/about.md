Nice to meet you. 

I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Linguistics at Northwestern University, working with Matt Goldrick at <a href="http://groups.linguistics.northwestern.edu/soundlab/v2/" title="">SoundLab</a>. I completed my PhD at McGill University and have taught at Concordia University, both in charming Montr√©al, QC. 

My research tackles topics in phonology, phonetics, and speech production. 

I've taught many topics including phonetics, psycholinguistics, language acquistion, cognitive science of language, and introductory linguistics. 

To learn more, take a look at my projects page, list of publications, and past course descriptions. You can also send me an email, tweet at me, or request any of my articles though ResearchGate.
